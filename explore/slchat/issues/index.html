        <h1>SLChat's Known Issues & Limitations</h1>
        <p>SLChat is under <strong>active development</strong> and is currently hosted on a <strong>free, limited platform</strong> using a single application architecture.</p>
        <p>As a result, certain issues and limitations may be occasionally encountered.</p>
        <p>This page documents the most commonly observed issues and explains their underlying causes to clear up any misconceptions and misunderstandings.</p>

                <span class="material-symbols-rounded icon">warning</span>
                <p>Broken CSS, JavaScript, or UI Glitches</p>
            </div>
            <div style="display: flex;gap: 10px;flex-direction: column;">
                <p>Occasionally, SLChat may appear visually broken or certain interface elements may not be functioning as expected.</p>
                <p>This issue is most commonly caused by frequent code changes combined with client-side caching and <strong>does not</strong> indicate permanent data loss or server malfunction..</p>
                <p>When updated CSS or JavaScript files are deployed, some clients may continue using cached versions of incompatible, older assets, resulting in mismatched or broken rendering.</p>
                <p>In most cases, this can be resolved by <strong>performing a hard refresh</strong> or <strong>clearing the browser cache</strong>.</p>

                <p>File Upload Limitations</p>
            </div>
            <div style="display: flex;gap: 10px;flex-direction: column;">
                <p>SLChat currently has <strong>limited support</strong> for file uploads, particularly for large images, videos, and other attachments.</p>
                <p>At present, SLChat does not have access to a dedicated content delivery network or a first-party media hosting solution, and instead relies on free third-party hosting services.</p>
                <p>The current media hosting service also does not support streaming uploads.</p>
                <p>As a result, files must be fully transferred in a single request.</p>
                <p>This constraint, coupled with SLChat's current architecture, makes large file uploads unfeasible.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="header">
                <span class="material-symbols-rounded icon">warning</span>
                <p>Connection Failures</p>
            </div>
            <div style="display: flex;gap: 10px;flex-direction: column;">
                <p>The error message "<strong>Connection to upstream failed: connection failure</strong>" typically indicates that SLChat is starting from an idle state.</p>
                <p>SLChat is hosted on a free platform that automatically shuts down the application after a period of inactivity.</p>
                <p>This behavior is partially intentional and serves two purposes:</p>
                <ol class="container">
                    <li>To avoid unnecessary resource usage and prevent abuse of free hosting resources.</li>
                    <li>To allow SLChat to recover from occasional, rare issues that causes the application to become unresponsive.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>When a new request is made after inactivity, SLChat must perform a cold start, which prevents connections until the startup is complete.</p>
                <p>This behavior is expected under the current hosting constraints and usually resolves itself after a short delay.</p>
                <p>The issue <strong>does not</strong> indicate permanent data loss or server malfunction.</p>
                <p>In most cases, <strong>refreshing the page</strong> after a few seconds is sufficient to restore the connection.</p>

                <p>Third-Party Service Dependency</p>
            </div>
            <div style="display: flex;gap: 10px;flex-direction: column;">
                <p>Some SLChat features rely on <strong>external services</strong> for functionality, most notably media hosting.</p>
                <p>If these third-party services are unavailable, rate-limited, or change their behavior, the affected SLChat features may <strong>degrade</strong> or <strong>stop functioning</strong>.</p>
                <p>Efforts have been made to reduce reliance on third parties where possible.</p>
                <p>Most recently, link preview rendering was previously handled by an external service, but has since been replaced by <a href="https://github.com/SLT-World/metafetcher" target="_blank">Metafetcher</a>, a first-party service developed and operated alongside SLChat.</p>

            </div>
            <div style="display: flex;gap: 10px;flex-direction: column;">
                <p>SLChat relies heavily on modern web technologies.</p>
                <p>Some older browsers may not fully support certain CSS or JavaScript features, which may result in visual or functional inconsistencies.</p>
                <p>For the best experience, a modern and up-to-date browser is recommended.</p>

            </div>
            <div style="display: flex;gap: 10px;flex-direction: column;">
                <p>Some features may behave inconsistently or change over time as SLChat continues to evolve.</p>
                <p>This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
                <ol class="container">
                    <li>Markdown rendering</li>
                    <li>Link previews</li>
                    <li>Experimental features</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Features may be removed, adjusted, disabled, or reworked without notice during development.</p>

                <p>Data Persistence Limitations</p>
            </div>
            <div style="display: flex;gap: 10px;flex-direction: column;">
                <p>Due to hosting constraints and ongoing architectural changes, message retention and server uptime are not guaranteed.</p>
                <p>Storage optimizations or migrations may occasionally result in temporary data loss or missing history.</p>
                <p>These events are rare but possible while SLChat remains in active development.</p>
