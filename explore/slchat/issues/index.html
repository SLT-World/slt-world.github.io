        <h1>SLChat's Known Issues & Limitations</h1>
        <p>SLChat is under <strong>active development</strong> and is currently hosted on a <strong>free, limited platform</strong> using a single application architecture.</p>
        <p>As a result, certain issues and limitations may be occasionally encountered.</p>
        <p>This page documents the most commonly observed issues and explains their underlying causes to clear up any misconceptions and misunderstandings.</p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="header">
                <span class="material-symbols-rounded icon">warning</span>
                <p>Broken CSS, JavaScript, or UI Glitches</p>
            </div>
            <div style="display: flex;gap: 10px;flex-direction: column;">
                <p>Occasionally, SLChat may appear visually broken or certain interface elements may not be functioning as expected.</p>
                <p>This issue is most commonly caused by frequent code changes combined with client-side caching.</p>
                <p>When updated CSS or JavaScript files are deployed, some clients may continue using cached versions of incompatible, older assets, resulting in mismatched or broken rendering.</p>
                <p>The issue does not indicate permanent data loss or server malfunction.</p>
                <p>In most cases, this can be resolved by <strong>performing a hard refresh</strong> or <strong>clearing the browser cache</strong>.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="header">
                <span class="material-symbols-rounded icon">warning</span>
                <p>Connection Failures</p>
            </div>
            <div style="display: flex;gap: 10px;flex-direction: column;">
                <p>The error message "<strong>Connection to upstream failed: connection failure</strong>" typically indicates that SLChat is starting from an idle state.</p>
                <p>SLChat is hosted on a free platform that automatically shuts down the application after a period of inactivity.</p>
                <p>This behavior is intentional and serves two purposes:</p>
                <ol class="container">
                    <li>To avoid unnecessary resource usage and prevent abuse of free hosting resources.</li>
                    <li>To allow SLChat to recover from occasional, rare issues that causes the application to become unresponsive.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>When a new request is made after inactivity, SLChat must perform a cold start, which prevents connections until the startup is complete.</p>
                <p>This behavior is expected under the current hosting constraints and usually resolves itself after a short delay.</p>
                <p>The issue does not indicate permanent data loss or server malfunction.</p>
                <p>In most cases, <strong>refreshing the page</strong> after a few seconds is sufficient to restore the connection.</p>

                <p>Browser Compatibility Limitations</p>
            </div>
            <div style="display: flex;gap: 10px;flex-direction: column;">
                <p>SLChat relies heavily on modern web technologies.</p>
                <p>Some older browsers may not fully support certain CSS or JavaScript features, which may result in visual or functional inconsistencies.</p>
                <p>For the best experience, a modern and up-to-date browser is recommended.</p>

                <p>Feature Instability</p>
            </div>
            <div style="display: flex;gap: 10px;flex-direction: column;">
                <p>Some features may behave inconsistently or change over time as SLChat continues to evolve.</p>
                <p>This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
                <ol class="container">
                    <li>Markdown rendering</li>
                    <li>Link previews</li>
                    <li>Experimental features</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Features may be removed, adjusted, disabled, or reworked without notice during development.</p>

                <p>Data Persistence Limitations</p>
            </div>
            <div style="display: flex;gap: 10px;flex-direction: column;">
                <p>Due to hosting constraints and ongoing architectural changes, message retention and server uptime are not guaranteed.</p>
                <p>Storage optimizations or migrations may occasionally result in temporary data loss or missing history.</p>
                <p>These events are rare but possible while SLChat remains in active development.</p>
